# Configuration Files

Here you find some config files I use in my work computer which is usually a unix based (mac or linux). Here is the key:

- `Rprofile`: Some settings applied when R sesions starts. 
- `.vimrc`  : Vim/MacVim configuration file
- `.gvimrc` : Vim GUI configuration file. Settings peculiar to Vim GUI go into this file.
